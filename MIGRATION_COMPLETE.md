## What Was Completed

### 1. Missing Files Created
- ✅ `middleware/validation.js` - Complete validation middleware with rules for payments, users, habits, meetings, feedback, and subscriptions
- ✅ `middleware/admin.js` - Role-based access control middleware 
- ✅ `utils/razorpayService.js` - Payment service wrapper with mock functionality
- ✅ `uploads/` directory - File upload storage directory
- ✅ Route aliases (`routes/meeting.js`, `routes/payment.js`)

### 2. Enhanced Existing Files

- ✅ **Subscription Controller** - Added complete implementation with all 23+ methods including admin functions
- ✅ **Meeting Controller** - Added all missing methods (getMyMeetings, acceptMeeting, rejectMeeting, rescheduleMeeting, addMeetingNotes, etc.)
- ✅ **Auth Middleware** - Added authorizeRoles, isAdmin functions
- ✅ **Payment Service** - Enhanced with graceful error handling and mock mode

### 3. Fixed Dependencies
- ✅ All route imports working
- ✅ All controller methods implemented
- ✅ All middleware functions available
- ✅ Proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Mock payment integration for development

## Current Status

✅ **All imports successful**
✅ **No missing dependencies**
✅ **Server ready to start**
✅ **Complete API functionality**

## Next Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file with your actual configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your actual values:
- Database credentials
- JWT secret
- Email configuration  
- Razorpay credentials (when ready for production)

### 2. Database Setup
The server will automatically:
- Test database connection
- Sync database models
- Seed default permissions

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
# Development mode with auto-restart
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

### 4. API Testing
The server will be available at:
- Health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- API endpoints: `http://localhost:3000/api/*`
